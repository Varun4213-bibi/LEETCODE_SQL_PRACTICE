select e.name AS Employee
from Employee e join Employee m
on e.managerId=m.id
where e.salary>m.salary

--used an INNER JOIN to compare salaries within the single Employee table. 
It aliases the table twice (e for Employee and m for Manager) and
links them using the condition: e.managerId = m.id. 
It then filters the result using WHERE e.salary > m.salary.
